# Overview
WML NoForm is a **formless** interface paradigm.  
This public-safe view omits internal logic and private mappings.

## What it is
- Adaptive, context-aware input flows (no static fields)
- Session-driven, minimal-step interactions

## What it is not
- No private mappings or production prompts
- No internal implementation details
